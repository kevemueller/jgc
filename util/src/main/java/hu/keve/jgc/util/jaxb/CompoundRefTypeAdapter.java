 * Special Adapter that works around the jaxb restriction of IDREF. IDREF is
 * hardcoded to use the text content of a node, which is empty for a composite
 * key with additional subelements.
 * 
 * We use the passed CompoundIDResolver to resolve our composite key to the
 * actual object. This XMLAdapter must be passed to Unmarshaller, it cannot be
 * created by the unmarshaller.
